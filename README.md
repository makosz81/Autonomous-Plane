This is to start learning control systems programing. First step should
be to define the problem. In this case I wil lbe taking a progressive
approach to a bigger problem. The major problem will be refined as I go.
It is very similar to my senior design problem. Seen at:
https://github.com/makosz81/Supersonic-rocket-control-system 
There is of course some changes in the problem considering that we are
working with a plane instead of a rocket. So I will copy some of the code
here and comment according to the new project. 

The new project problem can be seen on my website: http://autonomous-rc.com/index.html
Unlike with with the previous repository the problem will not be defined in the code itself. 
Unless I find explaingng the code and problem at the same thime to 
be easier like i did with the rocket problem.
